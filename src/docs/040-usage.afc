[chapter Usage]

Due to the way EL are compiled, you can use i18n on some different ways:

[code]
${i18n.your.message}
[/code]

or

[code]
${i18n["your.message"]}
[/code]

or even

[code]
${i18n.your["message"]}
[/code]

The second way is quite useful when you need get a message for an error added to the JSP or that is inside
a variable.
